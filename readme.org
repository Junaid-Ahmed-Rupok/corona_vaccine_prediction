This is merely a development branch. 

** what it is

It is an app that approaches the machine learning analysis of 'vaccine type prediction' 
based on some features.

With a view to achieving this goal, a huge dataset was collected beforehand and
was eventually handled with utmost precision for the analysis.

The analysis doesn't focus on only a single ML algorithm. It undertakes multiple ML algorithms
that include ensemble and tree type algorithms as well and eventually, the dataset was trained with
all the algorithms but the best one was selected using the cross validation technique.

** build the app

See [[file:BUILD-INFO.org][BUILD-INFO.org]] file for details.
